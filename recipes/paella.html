    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>paella, in Spanish cuisine, a dish of saffron-flavoured rice cooked with meats, seafood, and vegetables. Originating in the rice-growing areas on Spain's Mediterranean coast, the dish is especially associated with the region of Valencia.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Produce:</strong> Onion, bell pepper, garlic, tomatoes, parsley, frozen peas.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices:</strong> bay leaf, paprika, saffron, salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Saffron:</strong> this may be the most important ingredient, so it’s best to buy high quality. If your grocery store doesn’t carry it, try an International food market, or Amazon. If necessary, substitute 1 teaspoon saffron powder.</li>
        <li><strong>Seafood:</strong> jumbo shrimp, mussels, calamari.</li>
        <li><strong>Chicken thighs:</strong> I prefer thighs to breasts in the recipe since they don’t dry out as easily during longer cook times.</li>
        <li><strong>Olive Oil:</strong> Spanish olive oil , or any good quality olive oil.</li>
        <li><strong>White Wine</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Spanish Rice:</strong> See my notes below about the rice, and possible substitutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Chicken Broth:</strong> Authentic paella would include making your own fish stock from the discarded shells of seafood. I usually substitute chicken broth, for convenience.</li>
    </ul>
