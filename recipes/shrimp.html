    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>traditional Greek shrimp recipe that made me love shrimp again!  This recipe works as both an appetizer or as the main dish.  When I have it for dinner I pair it with greens (horta) and potatoes and white wine.  I think you will find this to be an amazing new way to cook shrimp that will add new flavor to both your parties and dinners.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 red pepper, thinly sliced</li>

        <li>1 pound medium sized shrimp, shells removed and de-veined</li>
        <li>1/2 pound feta, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>

        <li>inely chop herbs.</li>
