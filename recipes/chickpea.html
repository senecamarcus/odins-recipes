    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>traditional Greek shrimp recipe that made me love shrimp again!  This recipe works as both an appetizer or as the main dish.  When I have it for dinner I pair it with greens (horta) and potatoes and white wine.  I think you will find this to be an amazing new way to cook shrimp that will add new flavor to both your parties and dinners.</p>

        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
